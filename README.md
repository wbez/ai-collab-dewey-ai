Dewey is an AI-powered librarian designed to help newsrooms make their archives easy to search, making use of LLMs to provide cited responses. 

Archival research methods are cumbersome. Often times, they rely on keyword searches and date range filtering, making it difficult to surface topics without specific preexisting knowledge. Moreover, archives can live across disparate source systems/databases because of how content management systems evolve over time. Unifying these systems with a state-of-the-art search engine hopes to make archive research easier and more efficient for reporters.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/phillymedia/dewey-ai.git
cd dewey-ai
```

2. Create virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Configuration

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

1. Copy environment template
```
cp .env.template .env
```

2. Configure your `.env` file
*Note: While most environment variables must specify preexisting resources and deployments,`AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME` represents the desired name for your search index.*
```
# Azure OpenAI Configuration
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://your-resource.openai.azure.com"
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="your-azure-openai-api-key"
EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="your-embedding-deployment-name"
EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME="text-embedding-3-large"
CHATGPT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="your-chatgpt-deployment-name"
CHATGPT_MODEL_NAME="gpt-5"

# Azure AI Search Configuration
AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT="https://your-search-service.search.windows.net"
AZURE_SEARCH_API_KEY="your-azure-search-api-key"
AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME="your-search-index-name"  

# Azure Blob Storage Configuration
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=..."
AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME="your-storage-container-name"
```

## Deployment
1. Prepare Your Documents

Any articles you wish to upload should be in JSON format in the `data/` folder. Each document should follow this structure:

```json
{
    "id": "unique-document-id",
    "headline": "Article Title",
    "content": "Full article content...",
    "url": "https://example.com/article",
    "authors": ["Author 1", "Author 2", ...],
    "publish_date": "2025-09-09T12:00:00Z",
}
```

- `id` (optional) - A unique ID for your article. Will be autopopulated if you do not provide
- `headline` - A title to your article
- `content` - The full text to your article. It is up to you how to format this. **This will end up being your searchable field**
- `url` - A URL facing your article. This is critical for citation functionality
- `authors` - A list of author names from the article's byline
- `publish_date` - The date in which your article as published ([ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601))

2. Run Setup Script

```bash
python app/setup.py
```

This will:
- Validate your configuration
- Create Azure AI Search index with proper schema
- Set up skillsets for document processing (chunking and embedding)
- Create indexer for automated processing
- Upload documents to blob storage
- Process documents through AI Search pipeline

To force a full transcript reupload after transcript schema or chunking changes, run:

```bash
python app/setup.py --clean-transcripts
```

This deletes indexed transcript chunks, clears local transcript ingest state, and uploads fresh chunks.

3. Launch Dewey
```bash
python main.py
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:7860`. This project uses Gradio to create a user-friendly web interface for our machine learning model. You can learn more about Gradio at https://www.gradio.app/.

Set `GRADIO_SERVER_PORT` to run the web app on a different port. The Wavelength MCP server uses `WAVELENGTH_HTTP_PORT` separately.

### Slack Agent View

The Wavelength Slack app uses Slack Agent View, app mentions, DMs, and the `/wavelength` slash command. The Slack app should point event subscriptions at `/slack/events` and slash commands at `/slack/commands/wavelength`.

For production, expose the service over public HTTPS (TLS 1.2+) and configure `WAVELENGTH_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, `WAVELENGTH_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`, and the persistent `WAVELENGTH_STATE_DB` volume. Work Object Embeds also require `WAVELENGTH_EMBED_SIGNING_SECRET` and an HTTPS public base URL that is allowlisted in Slack's Work Objects and rich previews settings. The MCP endpoint accepts only the bearer token; Slack signatures authenticate only Slack routes. Set `WAVELENGTH_RESPONSES_MCP_ENABLED=true` after the public endpoint has been verified from Azure.

MCP remains available at `/mcp` for this project's own clients, but the Slack app manifest does not need `mcp:connect` or an `mcp_servers` entry.

Run the Slack/MCP HTTP service with:

```bash
python app/mcp_server.py
```


## Usage

1. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:7860`
2. **Ask questions** in natural language:
    - "What articles did *author X* about the election last month?"
    - "Summarize the last decade of coverage on *topic X*."
    - "Find me the best restaurants mentioned in 2024."
3. **Expand Dewey's though process** to see *what was searched* and *how many articles* were retrieved
